-- DECOR REPLICATION SCRIPT (Import)
-- Decor replication involves transfer of layers and table entries
-- These scripts handle ONLY decore table entries.  
-- Layer data should be shared manually if layers are updated!
--
-- This is the IMPORT script which requires you have:
-- A) Correctly labeled, updated layer files in C:/perpserver/data/layers
-- B) The results of the export script
-- The Import will also WIPE all existing DECOR on the same ZONE!
-- If you wish to "merge" decor, handle the conflict as you see fit.
--
-- How to use Import:
-- 0.  Set the correct ZoneID
-- 1.  From the provided export text file: copy the contents
-- 2.  Paste the contents between the 'REPLACE' and 'END REPLACE'
-- 3.  Remove the last trailing ',' (comma) and replace with ';' (semicolon)
-- 4.  Run the script
